## Overview
Asks for student names, marks, calculates grades, and displays a summary.

## 💡project Description
The Student  Report Card Generator is a python-based application designed to collect, process, and display academic performance data for students. It allows users to input student details, enter subject marks, automatically calculate grades, and visualize performance in a bar chart. The project also supports savings and loading student records to and from a file, making it practical for real-world usage

## KEY FEATURES:
1.User Input Handling: Collects student details and marks through interactive prompts.

2.Automated Grading: Calculates letter grades based on predefined score ranges.

3.Data storage: Saves and loads student reports using Json for persistence.

4.Data structures: Utilizes lists and dictionaries to store and process data efficiently.

5.Visualization: Generates a performance chart using matplotlib for easy handling

## 🧰Technologies Used:
-Python 3

-Matplotlib (data visualization)

-JSON (data persistence)

## 📊Skills Demonstrated:
Variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.
 
 -File handling (read/write operations)
