## Overview
Asks for student names, marks, calculates grades, and displays a summary.

## üí°project Description
The Student  Report Card Generator is a python-based application designed to collect, process, and display academic performance data for students. It allows users to input student details, enter subject marks, automatically calculate grades, and visualize performance in a bar chart. The project also supports savings and loading student records to and from a file, making it practical for real-world usage

## KEY FEATURES:
1.User Input Handling: Collects student details and marks through interactive prompts.

2.Automated Grading: Calculates letter grades based on predefined score ranges.

3.Data storage: Saves and loads student reports using Json for persistence.

4.Data structures: Utilizes lists and dictionaries to store and process data efficiently.

5.Visualization: Generates a performance chart using matplotlib for easy handling

## üß∞Technologies Used:
-Python 3

-Matplotlib (data visualization)

-JSON (data persistence)

## üìäSkills Demonstrated:
Variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.
 
 -File handling (read/write operations)
 -Data Visualization
 -Basic error handling
 -Modular code organization

 ## üóÑÔ∏èPortfolio value
This project highlights practical programming skills by combing data collection, processing, storage, and visualization- all essential in real-world software development. It demonstrates not only coding ability but also an understanding and maintainability
Reflection

Developing the Student Report Card Generator was a comprehensive learning experience that combined programming fundamentals with real-world problem solving.

From a technical standpoint, the project reinforced the importance of modular design, data validation, and robust error handling. The early challenges with input validation, GPA accuracy, and file handling taught the value of writing defensive code that anticipates user mistakes and environmental issues.

The inclusion of data visualization highlighted how presenting results clearly can significantly improve the user experience, while the transition from a large monolithic script to modular functions improved maintainability and readability.

overall, the project emphasized that successful software is not just about producing the correct output ‚Äî it‚Äôs about producing it reliably, clearly, and in a way that‚Äôs easy to maintain and enhance.


Final Thoughts

This project provided valuable exposure to problem-solving under constraints, user-centered design thinking, and the iterative nature of software development. The lessons learned will serve as a strong foundation for tackling more complex applications in the future, particularly those involving data management and visualization.
